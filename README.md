## 🎯 **Overview**

FLOW.STUDIO revolutionizes video production by providing **Story Intelligence** - understanding narrative relationships across scenes instead of just perfecting individual frames. Built for directors, content creators, and production teams who need professional video content with narrative coherence.

### **Revolutionary Architecture: Cinematic Modal System**
- **16:9 Aspect Ratio Enforcement**: True cinematic modal experience with adaptive layout design
- **Intelligent Progress Tracking**: Generated images persist until new ones arrive, eliminating premature resets
- **Conditional UX Controls**: Smart close button logic prevents accidental workflow interruption
- **Database-Centric Storage**: Complete FAL.ai → Supabase Storage → Database pipeline with permanent URLs
- **Enterprise Security**: RLS policies for authenticated uploads with public read access
- **Timeline Integrity**: masterJSON architecture maintains consistency across all development phases

### **Project Alignment Workflow Integration**
- **Session Start Protocol**: Systematic 3-phase workflow for project understanding
- **Documentation-First**: Automatic codebase scanning and status analysis
- **Web-Brother Methodology**: Consistent development approach across CLI and Web environments

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- Supabase account with database setup
- n8n workflow endpoint (for AI generation)

### **Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/flow-studio-mvp.git
cd flow-studio-mvp
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Configure your Supabase and n8n credentials in .env.local
npm run dev
```

### **First Project Workflow**
1. **Register/Login** → Secure authentication via Supabase
