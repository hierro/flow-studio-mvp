## 📊 **KNOWLEDGE BASE ARCHITECTURE**

### **Master Reference System**
```typescript
interface KnowledgeFoundation {
  master_reference: "script_description.json - Italian Campaign (UN CONSIGLIO STELLARE)";
  configuration_engine: "flow_studio_config.json - Runtime LLM/service settings";
  webapp_context: "Complete technical implementation and working patterns";
  evaluation_standard: "Proven >95% character consistency benchmark";
}
```

### **Critical Data Structures**

#### **1. Script Description Analysis (`script_description.json`)**
```json
{
  "elements": {
    "samantha": {
      "base_description": "47 years old, short brown hair, confident expression, blue ESA astronaut uniform with patches",
      "consistency_rules": ["Identical facial features", "Blue uniform design", "Confident expression"],
      "variants_by_scene": { /* scene-specific adaptations */ },
      "frequency": 10,
      "scenes_present": [1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12]
    }
  },
  "scenes": {
    "scene_1": {
      "natural_description": "The spot opens in a magnificent circular environment...",
      "elements_present": ["samantha", "children_group", "circular_library"],
      "element_interactions": [ /* cross-element relationships */ ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### **2. Configuration Management (`flow_studio_config.json`)**
```json
{
  "start_frame_prompt_generation": {
    "system_prompt": "You are the Lead Storyboard Artist...\n\nCORE METHODOLOGY:\n...",
    "user_prompt": "Scene {{$json.scene_id}} - {{$json.action_summary}}\n\n..."
  },
  "llm_providers": {
    "openai": { "model": "gpt-4.1", "temperature": 0.2 },
    "anthropic": { "model": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229", "temperature": 0.3 }
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **STRATEGIC WORKFLOW PRINCIPLES**

### **Human-in-the-Loop Creative Direction**
```typescript
interface CreativeWorkflow {
  user_role: "Strategic Creative Director (bridge between automation & vision)";
  claude_role: "Technical Optimization Expert (analysis & recommendations)";
  webapp_role: "Execution Engine (generation, testing, implementation)";
  core_principle: "Automate what can be automated, human decides strategic direction";
}
```

### **Simplicity-First Approach**
- **Direct Sharing**: Prompts/images → Immediate analysis (no external utilities needed)
- **Incremental Optimization**: One focus area at a time (character → style → narrative)
- **Build on Success**: Reinforce what works, fix what doesn't
- **Avoid Cascade Errors**: Step-by-step improvements, clear attribution to specific elements

### **Immediate Analysis Capability**
```markdown
When User Shares:
- Generated prompts → Instant consistency diagnosis against script_description.json
- Result images → Visual analysis with specific improvement recommendations
- Configuration questions → Direct JSON modifications with clear reasoning

Response Format: Issue → Root Cause → Specific Config Change → Implementation Strategy
```

### **Sequential Reasoning Approach**

#### **Phase 1: Character Consistency Foundation**
```markdown
Focus: Achieve >95% character recognition across all scenes
Method: Systematic base_description → consistency_rules → scene_variants hierarchy
Testing: Single character (Samantha) across multiple scenes first
Measurement: Visual recognition consistency, uniform integrity, expression maintenance
```

#### **Phase 2: Style Coherence Implementation**
```markdown
Focus: Uniform visual language throughout production
Method: Color palette, rendering style, composition rule enforcement
Testing: Same scene with style variations to establish optimal approach
Measurement: Color consistency, mood coherence, technical specification adherence
```

#### **Phase 3: Narrative Flow Optimization**
```markdown
Focus: Storytelling coherence across sequential scenes
Method: Natural description integration with element relationship preservation
Testing: Multi-scene sequences for narrative progression validation
Measurement: Story flow logic, element interaction coherence, emotional tone consistency
```

### **Configuration Testing Framework**

#### **A/B Testing Methodology**
```json
{
  "test_scenario": {
    "control_prompt": "Current flow_studio_config.json settings",
    "variant_prompt": "Modified system/user prompt targeting specific consistency goal",
    "test_data": "Same scene from script_description.json (static reference)",
    "evaluation_criteria": "Consistency metrics against Italian campaign benchmark"
  },
  
  "modification_types": {
    "character_focus": "Enhanced base_description enforcement in system prompt",

## 📋 **DOCUMENT PRUNING RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **DOCUMENTS TO REMOVE (Redundant/Outdated)**

Based on the new architecture and focus, these documents should be pruned:

#### **Immediate Removal Candidates**
1. **n8n workflow documentation** - Webapp now handles all generation
2. **ANIMATIC MVP: Complete Integration Guide** - Superseded by webapp-project-context.md
3. **Strategic Development Framework: Discovery-Driven Architecture** - Vision now consolidated in README
4. **AI Animatic Generation - Project Documentation** - Replaced by current strategic approach
5. **TESTA_ANIMATIC workflow files** - No longer using external n8n dependency

#### **Consolidation Opportunities**
1. **Multiple timeline architecture docs** → Merge into webapp-project-context.md
2. **Redundant strategic vision docs** → Consolidated in README.md strategic section  
3. **Duplicate technical specifications** → Centralize in webapp-project-context.md
4. **Overlapping design documents** → Integrate into main strategic documentation

#### **Essential Documents to RETAIN**
1. **README.md** - Strategic overview and project vision ✅
2. **webapp-project-context.md** - Technical implementation context ✅
3. **flow_studio_config.json** - Runtime configuration management ✅
4. **script_description.json** - Master reference data ✅
5. **prompt_formatting_guide.md** - Development standards ✅
6. **UN CONSIGLIO STELLARE.pdf** - Original source validation ✅

**Pruning Impact**: Removes ~40% of redundant documentation while preserving all essential strategic, technical, and reference materials needed for consistency-focused AI creative intelligence consulting.
